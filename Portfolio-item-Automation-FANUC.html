                    OBJECTIVE:
                </h1>
                <p> This project was given to the students to help us understand how to work on roboguide and program a fanuc robot 
                        using TCP and workobjects. The main task of the project goes as follows: On the faces of the two cylinders, run the tip 
                        of a welding tool in a circular path. Create three concentric paths with 50 mm separation between them. On a flat plate, 
                        create a pattern of lines 500mm long spaced 50 mm apart. Put 10 lines in the X direction, and 10 lines in the Y direction, 
                        to form a square pattern. Pick the weld tool tip off of the plate by 50mm between paths. The end result is shown in the video below.     
                </p>
                <h1>
                    PROCESS:
                </h1>
                <p> For this simulation to work, 7 positions were created. One at the starting position, another above the cylinder, the third 
                        at the center of the cylinder, the fourth above the second cylinder, the fifth at the center of the second cylinder, the 
                        sixth on the flat plate, and the seventh at the ending position between the flat plate and the cylinders. Using these 
                        positions we can create point registers which store data and can be manuipulated. By using these point registers I am 
                        able to prgram the robot to complete the task given to us. 
                </p>
                <p> There are three user frames set, one for each cylinder, and a third for the flat plate. User frames provides a way to 
                        specify a different coordinate system from the robot's base coordinate system, allowing myself to simplify programming 
                        and control robot movements relative to the specific references. For this case, it makes it easier to create the circles
                        on the cylinder as well as the pattern made on the flat plate.</p>

                <p>In total, there are 83 lines of code that allow the robot to complete the task stated above. Lines 1 through 5 set up the 
                        user frame and the user tool and tells the robot to move from position 1 to position 2 and then to position 3 which is at the 
                        center on the top of the first cylider. Once the tool is at position 3, the next step is for the robot to create 3 circles with 
                        a 50 mm seperation between each of them. To do this a couple of things need to be setup. First step is to create 4 point 
                        registers which is done on lines 6-9. This will allow us to manipulate the data to create the circle 3 times with a 50 mm seperation 
                        between them. The second step is creating registers that hold a value, in this case 50 and 1. Now that everything is set up, we enter 
                        LBL 1, where we perform the action of creating the circle. Lines 13-16 perform the calculations using the point registers and assign 
                        the results to different register positions. Lines 17-19 are when the robot creates the circle. Once each circle has been completed, R[3] 
                        increments by 1 and then compares that value to the number 3. If three circles have not been made, the code jumps back to LBL 1 and starts 
                        over. The code then tells the robot to move to position 4 and then to position 5 which is the center at the top of the second cyclinder. The 
                        program changes userframes and creates the three circles on the second cylinder, the same way it was done on the first. 
                </p>
                <img src="img\Fanuc_41_62.jpg" alt="code" class="Project2__img">
                <p> The code in Figure 2 above repersents the next steps that the program goes through. Once the robot has drawn the three circles on each cylinder, the robot 
                        moves back to the starting position (P[1]) and then switches to user frame 3 which is what will be used for the pattern on the flat plate. 
                        Three registers are set with a specific value given to each of them, being 50, R[1], 500, R[2], and 0, R[3]. We set 500 for the length that each 
                        line will be, we set the 50 to seperate each 500 mm line, and the 0 repersents the start of the loop. Since we want to create 10 vertical lines we 
                        set an if condition on line 62 that says if register R[3], that is originally zero, is equal to the number 9, then 10 loops have been performed. If 
                        the register is less than 9, R[3] increments by 1 and goes through the loop again. Line 47 is when the robotic arm moves to position 6 which is 
                        on the flat plate and then creates 3 different position registers. By creating these registers we are able to manipulate the current location data that 
                        the robot currently contains. The main goal is for the robot to weld a 500 mm vertical line, then lift the arm sligtly up to not touch the 
                        plate, go back to the previous starting point and add 50mm in the horizontal direction to create a new 500 mm line. In order to complete this, we need 
                        to manipulate the current location data everytime the loop starts. Lines 51 through 53 manipulate the data to allow the robot to complete the task 
                        mention aboved. We then move on to the start of the loop at line 54 being LBL[3]. Everytime we restart the loop the code will jump back to that line. 
                        Lines 55 through 60 is when the robot executes motion creating the vertical line. After each line is completed, R[3] increments by one as seen in line 
                        61 and then goes to the if condition in line 62, either restarting the process or allowing the code to move on to the final stage of this program. 
                </p>

                <p> The final stage of this program is to now weld another 10 lines but in the horizontal direction, the code for this can be seen above. To do this the robot goes back to position 6, where 
                        it started the vertical lines, and follows almost the exact same process as lines 44-62. The only difference in the code can be seen in lines 70-72 
                        which is when we create the position registers to tell the robot to move to a specific location. But instead on the robot welding in the y axis, the 
                        robot will now weld in the x axis. The rest of the code from lines 63 to 81 do the exact same thing as lines 44-62. Once the 10 lines has been created 
                        in the horizontal axis, the robot will switch to user frame 1 and go to position 7 which is its ending position.
