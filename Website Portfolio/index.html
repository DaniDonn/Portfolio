            <div class="About-me__body">
                <p> I am currently a 5th year Mechanical Engineering Technology Student at R.I.T located in Rochester NY. I work on
                    all types of projects that involve automation, programming, C.A.D., and designing. The main software I use for C.A.D.
                    is Solidworks as I know my way around the application very well. I also have expirience in using Creo, which I used while
                    working for Jabil. For Programming, my main language is python which I use in most of my code. I use python to code 
                    for computervision, nueral networks, raspberry PI's and Arduinos. I am also very comfterable using MATLAB to code as I 
                    have Used is for some of my projects at RIT. I also have expirience programming FANUC and ABB robots and am a certified
                    Fanuc Programmer.
                </p>
                <p> When I am not working on a projects or classworks, Im either thinking of new automation projects I could code, or drawing. 
                    I love making silly programs and just having fun learning how to code. I specifically like to code computer vision software.
                    I believe it is very useful and can be in just about anything, from quality to making games. I love being creative, and coming 
                    up with ideas that people have never heard of and do them straight away. This is why I enjoy drawing. I love making a drawing that
                    someone has never seen or thought of before. It makes me feel original and allows me to think of more "out of the box" ideas.

                <!--<h3>Acuity Polymers</h3>-->
                <p>
                    I worked at Acuity Polymers, located in Rochester NY, from February 2021 to August 2021 where we created specialty contact lenses materials for the specialty contact lenses industries to mass produce. The formula for each contact lens is made in a lab and then put into large rods 
                    and into the oven. After, the rods are taken out and cut into specific shapes and sizes, also known as buttons by using a cnc lathe, tested and then delivered to the contact lens industries. My job as a mechanical engineering co-op was to create contact lenses and buttons (contact lens templates) by using a CNC lathe, 
                    designe manufacturing plans for the contact lenses, and helped design an automatic system for the cast molding process.

                <!--<h3>Jabil</h3>-->
                <p>
                    I worked at Jabil in Elmira NY from July 2022 to January 2023 where we provided orthopedic products instruments and implants for internal and external fixation to surgically treat fractures, deformities and tumor diseases of long bones, shoulder, hand, pelvis, hip, condyles and foot. 
                    Additionally, Elmira manufactures veterinary plates and patient-specific implants (Jaw plates), which are shipped directly to hospitals. While working there I taught myself how to code in python and learned to program computer vision and nueral networks which I utilized to train a tab detection software. 
                    I also self taught myself Excel VBA which I used to create a map which can search and highlight a specific machine and area in Jabil. In addition to this I learned how to use G-code to re-program a probe on two CNC milling machines. I designed trays through creo for operators to easily identify an inspected part,
                    created an S.O.S. button on the raspberry pi which when pressed an email will automatically be sent out to the supervisor asking for help and a light will turn on at the area sending the signal.
