                <p> 
                    The main purpose of this project was to detect possible defects of finished machine products using computer vision.
                    Since Jabil produces large lots, it is possible to accidently send a part with a defect, in this case, a tab. Using 
                    computer vision was a great solution because we are able to train a model to teach the computer what a defect is and 
                    have it spot it for us, in case the opporators missed it. The way this detecter was set up was by plugging in
                    a USB camera to a raspberry Pi to see all incoming products one by one, lined up on a conveyor belt. If a product was 
                    seen to have a tab, the raspberry Pi would detect it and stop the conveyor belt from moving, which would allow the 
                    operator to fix the problem.  
                </p>
                <p> My mentor worked with me on this project as he was teaching me how to code in Python and how it could be applyed in 
                    automation and manufacturing. This was my first real coding project which taugh me the library OpenCV and how machine
                    learning works. The first step we took was getting over 100+ photos of the parts with tabs on them from different
                    orientations and brightness. Using these photos, we then label the area of the photo that we want the computer to detect.
                    This tells the computer specifically that every part of the photo labeled "tab" draw a bounding box around it, signaling 
                    its detection. The reason so many photos are used is because the model will be exposed to different variations 
                    of the objects and it will be more accurate in identifying them in new images.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These photos are split into testing and training, with about 80% of the photos given being used to train the model. The photos
                    are fed through darknet, an open source neural network API written in C, that utilizes the YOLO (you only look once) model
                    used to train the computer to detect objects. This was the next step taken for this project, and once the model was trained,
                    the program was able to execute. The next major problem was that the camera could not pick up the tab, as it was too small.
                    The solution to this was to write some code in python which broke the image into four quadrants and have the camera try to
                    detect the tab in each quadrant. What made this work was that the quadrant was used to zoom in on that section of the image, and 
                    as a result, the camera was able to detect the tab.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unfortunetly, due to my co-op ending I was not able to see this project to the end. However, the next step that I would've taken
                    to complete this is to design a conveyor belt using the Raspberry Pi to move each part underneath the camera and have it stop for
                    the camera to commence detecting the part for the tab. If the part did have a tab, it would signal the opperator by having a light 
                    flash, to fix the error, and then continue detecting each part as they flow down the conveyor belt.

                    This was the biggest project I worked on during my time at Jabil. It took about 2 and a half months to complete as I coded 
                    everything by myself and had to fill out the entire data table which took a lengthy amount of time. This project's main 
                    purpose is to search for any machine in the plant and to be able to find it on the plant layout to prevent employees from 
                    getting lost and to help them locate the machine faster in person. It works similarly to a map in the mall, where the user 
                    selects which store they want to find, and the map will visibly display where the store is located. The way this map works 
                    is very simple: the user just needs to type what machine in the plant they want to locate and press the search button, as 
                    seen in Figure 1 below.
                </p>
                <img src="img\cell_finder_image.jpg" alt="Main Page of search" class="Project2__img">
                <p> 
                    What happens as a result is the machine will be listed under the machine column as well as the cell (the specific area of the plant)
                    it is located at. If the user still does not know where the machine is located, a highlighted and rounded rectangle will appear over the 
                    machine on the plant layout, allowing the user to visibly see where in the plant the machine is located. This can be seen in Figure 2 below.

                </p>
                <img src="img\searchbox.jpg" alt="snapshot of code" class="Project2__img">
                <p>
                    If the user wanted to search for a certain cell on the plant layout, with all of the machines to be listed and to visibly see 
                    them on the map, all they would have to do is type in the cell name in the search bar. As a result, all the machines will be 
                    listed under the machine # column with its cell location written underneath the Cell column, and all the machines will have the 
                    highlighted rounded rectangle on its location on the plant layout. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the user is still unable to find the location, there is a “Go To Location” button, where it will allow the 
                    user to zoom in to the exact location of these highlighted rounded rectangles. Figure 3 below displays the code made for this button.  
                </p>
                <img src="img\view_location.jpg" alt="snapshot of code" class="Project2__img">
                <p>
                    This project was made by using visual basic code, as seen in Figure 4 below, which provided the functionality of the search, the go to 
                    location button, and the clear all button on the main page.  
                </p>
                <img src="img\code_cell_finder_image.jpg" alt="snapshot of code" class="Project2__img">
                <p>
                    The way this code works is by taking in the desired machine or cell and comparing it to a list of all the machines and/or cell 
                    names in the plant on the data page. On this data page we have the cell name, the machine number in accordance with the cell 
                    location, the x and y locations on the machines on the plant layout, the date when that machine was last checked on, and a 
                    completion symbol which shows that row has all the information filled out, as shown in Figure 5 below.
                </p>
                <img src="img\data_sheet.jpg" alt="snapshot of code" class="Project2__img">
                <p>
                    The x and y locations are specific coordinate points on the excel sheet where the plant layout is. However because of the NDA 
                    I signed I am unable to show this map. Each machine has a specific x and y coordinate point which were retrieved and placed in 
                    this data sheet. These coordinate points were retrieved in a special way. I wrote up some code that would print out the coordinate 
                    points of the highlighted rounded rectangle whenever it appeared, which can be seen in Figure 6 below. I took this shape and dragged it
                    over a machine number, then I would select a find an x and y location button which would make the coordinate points appear in an 
                    empty column on the excel sheet.

                <p>
                    Overall, I feel as though this project was very successful. It was able to do exactly what it was programmed to do and was a great experience 
                    to learn how to code in visual basic, especially since I had never learned/worked with it before.

            <p class="section__subtitle section__title--Project3">Using a raspberry Pi, a Light, a Pushbutton and a Relay, coded in Python </p>
            
            <div class="Project3__body">
                <p>This was a short project I worked on at Jabil, but it really allowed me to learn how automating a task can benefit the plant as well 
                    as build up my programing skills. The main goal of this project goes as follows: If an operater is having an issue and needs 
                    a supervisor to come over, a button would be pushed and a flashing light will turn on. When the button is pushed, an email
                    will automatically be sent to that operator's supervisor asking for them to come over. The flashing light allows the supervisor 
                    to easily locate where the operator is. This whole operation was coded on a raspberry Pi in Python and although I am unable to
                    display the code, as a result of signing an NDA, I can walk through the process of how the code works. The image below shows 
                    what the button was assembled.  
                </p>
                <img src="img\SOS_button.jpg" alt="snapshot of code" class="Project3__img">
                <p> The first step that had to be complete was making sure the button and light worked properly. This was tested by having the output
                    turn on the relay which as a result, turned on the light. The next step was to set up a text file which would hold the information 
                    of supervisors during specific shift times as well as the sender email. A parser program would be coded as the following step to go 
                    through each line of the text file and grab the information and to put them into a tuple. The reason we use a tuple instead of a list 
                    is to put in different data types which was what we needed to do. How did it know which supervisor to grab from the text file? The answer 
                    to this was dependent on the time. Each supervisor in the text file has a shift time associated with them, so once the parser code has 
                    put all the information in a tuple, the program jumps over to a method that gets the time of the day and compares the gotten times with 
                    the shift times listed in the text file. Now that that the program knows which supervisor to send the email to, we need to write code to 
                    open and login to gmail as well as write the email and send it automatically. To do this we use the Selenium Webdriver to gain access to 
                    the URL to open it. Then we use MIMEMultipart and MIMEText to write the message. Finally we use the smtplib module to send the email to the 
                    supervisor.
